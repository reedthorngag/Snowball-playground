        <p>Kia Ora, we are a year 13 YES business group from Otumoetai College called Unifirm. Our aim is to increase sustainability and efficiency through streamlined processes and systems. Our innovation is creatinga technical solution to managing school issued clothing items. We have found most schools currently use pen and paper, which does not assist school uniform coordinators in missing clothes items. With this system schools are able to keep track of clothing items and reduce manual work. Our group, in search of helping with this, have created a product and service that offers schools a new alternative to managing schoolowned clothing.<br /><br />Our product consists of RFID tags and scanners that can be used to track schoolclothing items. Firstly the tags must be installed into the school clothing and setup the data of the clothes into the system. The tags will be installed by schools withan iron, that way coordinators are able to find the best place the tag can be placedon or in the uniform. The system which will connect the scanner and tags togetheris an application schools are able to login to which, relevant to the school, is able tohold data of what the clothing piece is and student details. The coordinator is thenable to use the scanner to issue and return uniforms while the databaseautomatically updates. Connecting the item to the current holder. This ensuresevery item is issued, accounted for, and returned. Solving the problem of schoolsports and formal uniforms not being returned and increasing efficiency andsustainability. This would help with the decrease of uniforms not being returned and or missingitems as well as unnecessary man hours being spent on managing the followingup on the clothing. Increasing sustainable and efficient. Enabling schools to investtheir money into more important matters.</p>
